## Three simple questions to set the tone for the meeting: 
    *What did I work on yesterday?
    *What am I working on today?
    *What issues are blocking me?

## More Questions

    *What is the current progress of the team as a whole?
    *What aspect might need more time?
    *What aspect needs more people to finish the task?
    *What is the current timeline looking like?
    *What are some new changes that have been added?
    *What are some new changes that have been removed?

## Time Allocation for Stand-Up

The stand-up should be short and to the point, so it should range from 15-30 minutes to get a good sense of what is going on.

## Participation

It is a good idea to have a talking stick, or "popcorn" to someone else once one person is done talking till everyone has shared their input.

## Feedback

Take feedback at the end of the stand-up to see how to make the next meeting more efficient and productive.

## Setup for Stand-ups 
    *Each person should be able to see everyone in the call (gallery view)
    *Everyone should have videos on
    *Presentation/Software to present should be accessible by everyone
    *All files shared before stand-up
    *Make sure the recording is on for team members not present
