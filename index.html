            <br />
                <b><i>List of things that happened today</i></b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Attend Classes</li>
                    <li>Complete RA Administrative Work</li>
                    <li>Catch up with Family</li>
                     <li>Grab dinner with friends</li>
                </ol>
            <br />
            <p>I started of the day by attending my 8AM class. I then grabbed breakfast from CV before I headed out to complete my
                 workout for the day. I then got back in time to attend my 11AM class, which was the last one for the day. I then
                  finished my homework so I could be done with school for the day. <br />
                  However, since I am also a Resident Assistant, I had a lot of pending administrative work I had to complete for the week.
                   After I was done with logging my duty hours, sending emails, and talking to residents, I had to start preparing for my 
                   program on Monday (12th April). <br />
                 I then talked to my family back home on facetime before heading out to Grab dinner with some friends. We went to one 
                 of my favorite places, SimSim. That was all for this day. 
            </p>
            <p>Here is also a small part of one of my favorite songs I heard after a long time.

            <span style="color:red;">A Relaxed Day</span>
            <br />
                <b><i>Here are my goals for today</i></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wake up before 12PM</li>
                    <li>Catch up on emails</li>
                    <li>Go watch the sunset</li>
                     <li>Grab my dinner</li>
                </ul>
            <br />
            <p>Since yesterday was a very tiring day, I decided to sleep in. However, I still wanted to wake up before 12PM. 
                I was very close to not meeting this goal, as a knock on my door by a resident luckily woke me up by 11:30AM :)<br />
                I had to respond to some emails from the day before, which included some questions about on campus resources from residents,
                some information about upcoming events, and also some emails with work for my CSE 110 Group. This didn't take long and I was done quickly. <br />
                The last main thing on my agends was to go watch the sunset. I finished my workout for the day around 6PM, and quickly got on bus 30, 
                so that I could get to La Jolla Cove by 7pm. <br />
                Here is an image of the sunset I took: <br />

            <span style="color:red;">The Final Boss: Procrastination</span>
            <br />
                <strong><em>Since I didn't do much yesterday, I had these things to finish today</em></strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a morning workout in before breakfast</li>
                    <li>Catch up on emails</li>
                    <li>Finish my Lab for CSE 110</li>
                     <li>Finish my HW for my ECE class</li>
                     <li>Finish RA Admin Work</li>
                </ul>
            <br />
            <p> There was a lot of work to catch up on today, since I had been procrastination for so long. I first started 
                off my day by finishing a quick arm and core workout. I also grabbed some breakfast, a lot of eggs, from CV <br />

                I then caught up on some emails from residents and my work, before starting my homework that is due tonight at 11:59pm. 
                I was mostly done with my Lab for CSE 110 but there were some final things left. I also had to finish my remaining 
                homework for my ECE class. <br />
                After I was done with all of my school work, I had some final RA admin work such as filling out my time log that I had to complete
                 and email to my supervisor. I also found a funny video of my dog, Buzz, which you can watch as well.
